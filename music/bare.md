### Spatial audio

Most of the Basura record is also spatial audio, but it is released as
stereo.

#### Untitled (6 channel mixdown) {#untitled-6chan-mix}

\"Untitled\" is a question regarding creativity, unpredictability and
mechanical determinism. The audio consists of random and chaos
generators in real-time synthesis. The video contains images of
turbulence taken from a river in Cordoba (Argentina), cellular automata
noise, and randomized nouns. The score has ordered sections made out of
randomized variables, and the last section requires some human action.
Sounds and images were made with Pure Data for the Immersion Lab at NYU
Bobst Library.
