        intersection of sound and machine learning—with a particular focus on
        how databases shape musical composition Federico builds digital
        instruments for live performance using signal analysis and Pure Data,
        and he designs immersive sound experiences for both multichannel setups
        and headphone listening His research also explores unsupervised learning
        techniques applied to audio and image analysis, through which he
        develops and theorizes multimedia database systems that connect sound,
        visuals, space, and performance All of his music, research, and code is
        shared openly.
