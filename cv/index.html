<blockquote >This dissertation outlines a framework to discuss the aesthetic agency of the database in music composition. I place my dissertation in relation to existing scholarship, artists, and developers working in the fields of music composition, computer science, affect, and ontology, with emphasis on the ubiquity of databases and on the need to reflect on their practice, particularly in relation to databasing and music composition. There is a database everywhere, anytime, always already affecting our lives; it is an agent in our aesthetic and political lives just as much as we are agents in its composition and performance. Database music lives in between computers and sound. My argument is that in order to conceptualize the agency of the database in music composition, we need to trace the history of the practice, in both its technical and its artistic use, so as to find nodes of action that have an effect on the resulting aesthetics.</blockquote></details></p></article>

To create performances in various sized ensembles to understand the relationships among performing, composing, improvisation, notation, and - yes - computer programming and hardware hacking. To understand the relationships between “traditional” musical instruments and electronically created or enhanced musical instruments. To make us think about how the changing nature of what an “instrument” is affects our conception of music and sound. Co-taught with Dr. Marc Ainger.

<p title="Lockdowns and travel restrictions have not only affected our own music classes and artistic research, but have also profoundly changed music performance worldwide. In other words, since musicians cannot meet in the same room to play music with each other, they have learned to move their musical performance to the network. We argue that this translation can be thought of as a new opportunity to rethink music and music performance research, considering the network as a new performative space. As a case study, we present a '1002', a collaborative networked performance created using a custom software called 'CollidePd'. '1002' is an invitation to anonymous collaboration in real time with remote performers, without any required musical training. The sonic research of this performance is based on the sonification of the musical gesture mediated by the mobile device, emphasizing the participatory movement of the performers."><em >1002: A Networked Music Performance with CollidePd</em> (1 year) (Networked Performance).

<p title="The Woods is a mixed-reality multiplayer cooperative game that addresses the perils of social isolation by promoting connections between people and actively engaging them through play. Using Augmented Reality (AR) and 4-channel audio spatialization panning, players choreograph their movement in real-world space, while interacting with birds, clouds and other objects in virtual space. In pursuit of a shared goal, players experience an immersive sonic narrative of rumbling storm clouds and disconnected voices that culminate in stories of hope and reconciliation. `The Woods’ provides positive social impact by illuminating our connections to one another and inspiring us to respond through collaboration."><em >The Woods: A Mixed Reality Two-Player Cooperative Game</em> (2 years) (Augmented Reality Spatialization).

<blockquote >pix_fft is an open-source Gem Pix object for performing 2D Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) on images and camera input within Pure Data (Pd). Since Gem does not natively support FFT via FFTW, this object extends its functionality by enabling real-time frequency domain analysis and visualization of 2D images. The implementation leverages FFTW for efficient Fourier transformations, optimizing performance after the initial computation. Users can trigger FFT calculations via bang messages, and the input image can be dynamically resized or adjusted via optional arguments. By facilitating real-time spectral analysis and image transformation, pix_fft is a powerful tool for artists, researchers, and developers working with audiovisual synthesis, image processing, and computational creativity within the Pure Data environment.</blockquote></details></p></article>

<p title="This paper describes and discusses several approaches to working with massively multichannel music live using pure data. traditionally, most computer music works have had a tendency towards fixed media due to its stability and robustness when it comes to performance. Likewise, the spatialization paradigm that has governed most electronic music continues to be stereo, with the use of diffusion or ambisonics as last resort spatialization techniques. Emphasizing the importance of space, this paper describes the design of a real-time computer music piece called Lorenz Variations, written directly for high density loudspeaker arrays (HDLAs) of variable lengths. In using point-source location techniques and vector-based amplitude panning (VBAP) as composing tools instead of spatialization tools, I argue that space is not just a musical parameter but a compositional source that expands our listening experience into yet unknown dimensions, and it is our duty to explore the many aesthetic potentials it advances..

<p title="The aim of this dissertation is to outline a framework to discuss the aesthetic agency of the database in music composition. I place my dissertation in relation to existing scholarship, artists, and developers working in the fields of music composition, computer science, affect, and ontology, with emphasis on the ubiquity of databases and on the need to reflect on their practice, particularly in relation to databasing and music composition. There is a database everywhere, anytime, always already affecting our lives; it is an agent in our aesthetic and political lives just as much as we are agents in its composition and performance. Database music lives in between computers and sound. My argument is that in order to conceptualize the agency of the database in music composition, we need to trace the history of the practice, in both its technical and its artistic use, so as to find nodes of action that have an effect on the resulting aesthetics. Therefore, this dissertation is composed of two main sections. In the first part, I trace a history of database practices from three points of view. The first is from new media theory, emphasizing the intersection between the database and the body. The second is from the history of the database in computer science, giving a panoramic view of the tools and concepts behind database systems, models, structures. The third is from their use in sound practices, describing different approaches to databasing from the fields of music information retrieval, sonification, and computer music. In the second part, I discuss the agency of the database under the broader concepts of sound, self, and community. These three axes are addressed in four sections, each with a different perspective. First I focus on listening and present the database as a resonant subject in a networked relation and community with the human. Second, I focus on memory, comparing human memory and writing with digital information storing, thus relating databasing and composition with memory, archives, and their spectrality. Third, I analyze the performativity of databasing, understanding the database as gendered, in its temporality, repetition, and in its contingent appearance as style, skin, and timbre. In the last section, I revise the notion of music work, reflecting on the consequences of the anarchic and the inoperative in the community of database music. As an appendix, I present an open-source library for making and performing a multimodal database that combines computer vision and timbre analysis algorithms to generate a database of image and audio descriptors suitable for automated navigation, querying, and live audio-visual performance."><em >Database Music: A History, Technology, and Aesthetics of the Database in Music Composition</em> (1 year) (Database Aesthetics).

<blockquote >MMDB is a multimodal database system designed for live querying of image and audio data by integrating visual and auditory modalities. It processes image collections—whether user-collected, web-sourced, or algorithmically generated—by normalizing them and extracting descriptive features. These descriptors are stored in both a compact text file for sorting and a detailed JSON database for querying. A unique aspect of MMDB is its use of color words extracted from images to link visual data with sound. By leveraging the Datamuse API to retrieve related nouns and querying Freesound.org for corresponding audio files, MMDB creates a database that aligns images with sounds based on semantic relationships. The system enables real-time multimodal queries, displaying matched images and audio as an interactive audiovisual stream, where specific image features correspond to particular sound characteristics. MMDB facilitates creative applications in digital arts, machine learning, and interactive media by providing a dynamic platform for exploring relationships between visual and auditory data.</blockquote></details></p></article>

<p title="The practice of composition takes place from the most distant memory of sound to the intimacy of perceivable waves. For music to emerge from these waves, two negative processes need to take place, relating to consciousness, memory, and difference. These constitute the possibility condition of what I call the unveiling, staging, and unworking of the music object. From this rethinking of the composition practice, how does identity emerge from this precondition of difference? This is how the database enters into this framing of the practice of composition. Drawing from Derrida’s conceptualization of the archive, I find the ‘archontic’ principle embedded within the structural quality of the database, and emerging through its performance. The computer is a multitude of databases constantly projecting their authority, their archontic power onto their users. Thus, in the same way the written word becomes the rule, just as the structured data prescribes its command, the severed object of music emerges as style, order, or identity. The question is, however, how can we conceive the aesthetic experience without this authoritative character; without this inherent imposition of order and identity? The space is opened, thus, for the concept of an anarchic unwork of art."><em >Composing Database: Opening A Space For The Concept Of An Anarchic Unwork Of Art</em> (10 days) (Database Aesthetics) Delian Academy for New Music.

We briefly explore previous approaches to image soni- fication, and propose that through video-based convolution new conceptualizations of the self can arise. Further, this expression of the self is neither centered on the human par- ticipant nor on the socially constructed notions of the self, but on nonhuman aspects such as the reflection and capture of light, or the technological array of the installation as such. The participant’s exploration within this spectrality results in an uncanny and playful experience.</blockquote></details></p></article>

<p title="A black box room packed with a rather large audience surrounded by 16 Genelec speakers set as two rings of 8, with an elevation of about 1.5 meters. I arrived just in time for the concert and there were barely any seats left. I sat at the back with my head right behind speaker no. 5 –a quite ‘bad’ location to listen to spatialized music inside a dome. I had the old fear one might encounter in an electroacoustic concert if one is not sitting around the ‘sweet spot’.1 Despite my fears –and this is why I am writing this–, Dr. Justel started playing Marelle2 and I could listen to her music inside the entire space in front of me. How did she achieve a complete multidimensional image that can be grasped from a point other than the center of the listening space? To what extent is this composition inherent to a particular spatial distribution? How can I go about showing this?

<blockquote >Abejas is a computer music spatial work that explores the movement of bees through sound using synthetic soundscapes. The soundscapes are dense and spatially rich, and the work moves through them in an extremely precise and changing manner, inviting the listener to actively engage with the sound. The work also expands on the concept of emergence and its manifestations in the sonic domain, where the listener is an active agent in understanding sonic emergence.
The Bees Algorithm is used to find the global optimum of a given function and simulates the behavior of a swarm of bees, where some bees are employed as scouts and others as followers. This algorithm has been applied to a variety of optimization problems such as function optimization and sound source localization. In this work, the algorithm is applied to spatial audio and modified to output the least optimal solution and other solutions that do not achieve best results
This gesture highlights the complex relation between nature and synthesis, the human and the non-human, and places environmental awareness at the center using sound.</blockquote></details></p></article>

<p ><em >1002: A Collaborative Networked Performance with CollidePd</em> (Browser-Based Networked Musical Instrument)
<details ><summary >More</summary>
<blockquote >Lockdowns and travel restrictions have not only affected our own music classes and artistic research, but have also profoundly changed music performance worldwide. In other words, since musicians cannot meet in the same room to play music with each other, they have learned to move their musical performance to the network. We argue that this translation can be thought of as a new opportunity to rethink music and music performance research, considering the network as a new performative space. As a case study, we present a "1002", a collaborative networked performance created using a custom software called "CollidePd". "1002" is an invitation to anonymous collaboration in real time with remote performers, without any required musical training. The sonic research of this performance is based on the sonification of the musical gesture mediated by the mobile device, emphasizing the participatory movement of the performers.

<details ><summary >More</summary>
<blockquote >While research has shown both physiological and emotional connections drawn through the power of the human voice, “The Woods” employs it as a mechanism for expressing motivation and intent in its narrative. The immersive real-time soundscape of “The Woods” is arrived at with 4-channel audio, using a combination of spatialization techniques, such as point-source spatialization, vector-based amplitude panning, and ambisonics. We accomplish this with the open source graphical programming environment, Pure Data, that we interface with Unity3D (our game engine) with OSC messages sent on a local network. Our audio setup is designed to expand virtual space beyond the phone screen, making the storm clouds perceptible as sonic experiences as they drift by the players. As a metaphor, the storm clouds symbolize obstacles that make connecting with others difficult. In contrast to the global sounds of the storm, the brother’s voicemail (delivered by the birds after they have perched on the branch) is played only through the phones’ speakers to provide a more intimate and private experience for the players.

<p ><em >desacuerdos</em> (Electroacoustics)
<details ><summary >More</summary>
<blockquote >desacuerdos is a very short space work whose completely generative material comes from different interpretations of the solution of the equations of the Lorenz system. Also known as "the Lorenz attractor", this system promotes a movement in space similar to the drawing on the wings of a butterfly. Each interpretation takes unique gestures of the signal, such as a change of direction, or of position in space. The individuality of each gesture is given by the different initial positions which, however small the distance between them, cause very serious effects on future gestures. This concept, which speaks of the chaotic state of the system, can perhaps orient us in the crossing, in the cracks, in the middle of the abyss, where the orientation is imperceptible, original, but does not escape to be imagined. The stereo reduction of the work allows for many of the spatial nuances that arise from its multi-channel version. The original composition was made for a 16.2 channel system.</blockquote></details></p></article>

<p ><em >untitled2</em> (Laptop And Multichannel Audio)
<details ><summary >More</summary>
<blockquote >Immersed in a digital environment, “untitled2” lives at the limit between field recording and synthesis, soundscape composition, and sound art. This liminality aims to resonate its way into the complex difference between art and life, and between the human and the non human. The sound design of “untitled2” is geared towards emulating transducer signals from soundscape recordings. In order to achieve this, I recorded several soundscapes in different locations in Mykonos, Greece, analyzed the signals, and deconstructed them in their most basic perceivable elements. Thus, there are sounds that resemble seagulls, other types of birds, cicadas, storms, wind, among others. Most of these sounds are granular in nature, allowing for the possibility to spatialize them using algorithms such as the flocking algorithm and the Lorenz system of equations. The original setup was for four channels, but by design the number of channels is variable. Therefore, the work is adaptable to any configuration of speakers of any kind, with the requirement of at least one subwoofer. The four channel version and stereo reduction of the piece have been recorded from live performance. This means that the work itself is meant to be performed live on a laptop with some basic guidelines. In addition to these guidelines, I have written the following text (in spanish) as inspiration for the first section: truena de repente // gaviotas gritan giran // rondando // // llueve a lo lejos // lluvia cae de cerca // rondando // // gritan giran gaviotas // y se van, ellas // al olvido // The liminality of the piece appears as well in the narrow gap between silence and sound that very quiet moments point to, as well as the complete spectral saturation towards its climactic moment close to its ending. This gesture towards saturation comes from the accelerating way in which one sound generator is triggered. Specifically, the real-time computation of the chaotic system of equations commonly referred to as the Lorenz system is accelerated from one millisecond to less than 1/1000 of a millisecond, approaching computational zero-time, intentionally clogging the computer’s real-time audio capabilities. These two poles of “untitled2,” soundscape reconstruction and computational saturation, comment on the complex, but present difference between sonic art and sonic life. The proximity between the reconstructed signal and its original creates a third sonic image, one that I like to call a ghost signal. This ghost signal permeates through the work as if it were the “real” version, turning the listening experience into an experience of the uncanny. This mysterious and unsettling experience, however, only appears in hindsight, after the piece has reached its climactic moment: the moment of complete saturation the second pole projects. Therefore, in listening to “untitled2,” I invite the listener to contemplate on the human role in its environment. “Untitled2” was composed and premiered during the ``Delian Academy for New Music'' held in Mikonos, Greece, in June 2018</blockquote></details></p></article>

<blockquote >Untitled is a question regarding creativity, unpredictability and mechanical determinism. The audio consists of random and chaos generators in real-time synthesis. The video contains images of turbulence taken from a river in Córdoba (Argentina), cellular automata noise, and randomized nouns. The score has ordered sections made out of randomized variables, and the last section requires some human action. Sounds and images were made with Pure Data for the Immersion Lab at NYU Bobst Library. The work was performed at the Third Cube Fest in 2018: "Federico Cámara Halac's Untitled was captivating in its raw approach to spatial music. Dry, glitchy sounds, including clicks, were pointillistically placed in time and space, sometimes darting across the speaker array, while the visuals showed words appearing and collapsing. Unfortunately, the piece ended prematurely when the composer's Pure Data patch crashed. Upon reflection, however, this was a refreshingly different way to end a concert, and suited the glitch aesthetic of the piece, albeit accidentally so." Malinowski, D. J.

While a significant component of the installation is visual, the audio acts via sonification to extend the perception beyond just what the eye can see. The audience is invited to experience spectral properties outside of the more familiar visible wavelengths.

<p ><em >Lorenz Variations</em> (Computer Performer And An Hdla Or As Many Speakers As Possible)
<details ><summary >More</summary>
<blockquote >Lorenz Variations focuses on the different interpretations of the Lorenz System, both as signal and control generator, exploring its patterns and deviations in several time-scales. More importantly, the piece relies on the computer's capability for live and extremely fast computations of the Lorenz System, reaching a point of complete CPU saturation that might crash the piece. Thus, it questions the endurance and virtuosity of the most current processing units, as well as Pure Data's DSP chain tethered through the C programming language. The choice is then, at least on macos where this work was first performed, to use portaudio or Jack, but that should be left to the computer performer. The piece has 3 sections, each of which has it's own texture and treatment but is linked in some way by the use of this system. Towards the end, there's a single gesture which simultaneously moves from space to pitch-space, and from computational stability to overload and saturation, resulting in a drastic sonic change. Lorenz Variations is the result of the Spatial Music Workshop during the Cube Fest 2017 at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, VA. About the workshosp: together with 6 other participants, we developed site specific research and compositions for the Cube, which consists of 149 speakers in a series of rings that go from the stage up to 30m ceiling surrounding the entire space.

<p ><em >a.le.a</em> (Flute, Clarinet (Bb), Violin, Cello, Percussion, Piano, And Live Electronics And Video)
<details ><summary >More</summary>
<blockquote >This music was generated using the a.le.a library for Pure Data (Pd) written and played by the composer. The library uses an algorithm for swarm behavior together with the Lorenz attractor in such a way that five boids follow the famous chaotic attractor. The a.le.a library provides an interface to monitor and interact with both the Lorenz and the boids paths, thus adding to the influence of the boids' movements a human element - that of the player of the meta-score (the composer). The interface captures the results of the interaction of the trio (player, boids, attractor) and outputs the data to both a video file and a text file. The video is used for part of the visual aspect of the performance. The text is used to generate a set of four meta-scores which indicate curves of transition between three elements (in this case, the electronics, the instrumental and the visual). This algorithmic absurdity in a.le.a aims at being not a 'mapping' of the motion of the birds into musical structures, but as the triggering of events and transitions based on some properties of the line that goes through all the boids. The instrumental score is then interpreted from this output into hand-crafted gestural snippets of Lilypond code (via the [notes] external for puredata) which belong to each of the six instruments of the ensemble. This interpretation produces four fullscores (one for each meta-score). For this performance, the composer hand-trimmed and re-interpreted some absurdly incoherent blobs of ink on the page into absurdly incoherent musical gestures, choosing from all of the four fullscores arriving at a final score. The electronics and the video are generated live. They both take the third -human- element from the live analysis of the player's signals, and they both consist of spectra transformations and granular synthesis. a.le.a is not a work, it is the unworking of a work. It is not only the performative result in itself, but also the path of its unworking. The audience is invited to listen for these traces.</blockquote></details></p></article>

<details ><summary >More</summary>
<blockquote >All players have one instrument and one potentiometer. The players follow the score performing both with their potentiometer and with their instrument. The data obtained from the potentiometers is then interpreted as the speed at which a [lorenz] system is iterated (which is between 0.001 and 1 every sample, at a given samplerate, e.g 44100 Hz). The output (X,Y,Z) from each system is interpreted in two ways: first, it is read as a signal and added altogether; second, it is parsed through [siginfo] to obtain slope changes, which are as well read as signals and added altogether. Finally, the distance obtained from [siginfo] serves as gain for the final signal. One player can be given a midi input to trigger randomized variables for all (or each) lorenz system(s), generating divergence among the randomized systems. Within this midi input, one note (MIDI Note 72) serves as on/off switch for the patch. A timer is provided on the screen. The whole work lasts at least 6 minutes, but the duration bends when there are CPU overloads. It is encouraged to "surf" in and out of those CPU overloads by simply changing the potentiometer to a value closer to 1, or to 0 in case there is a need to stop all iterations from the potentiometer involved.

<p title="The practice of composition takes place from the most distant memory of sound to the intimacy of perceivable waves. For music to emerge from these waves, two negative processes need to take place, relating to consciousness, memory, and difference. These constitute the possibility condition of what I call the unveiling, staging, and unworking of the music object. From this rethinking of the composition practice, how does identity emerge from this precondition of difference? This is how the database enters into this framing of the practice of composition. Drawing from Derrida’s conceptualization of the archive, I find the ‘archontic’ principle embedded within the structural quality of the database, and emerging through its performance. The computer is a multitude of databases constantly projecting their authority, their archontic power onto their users. Thus, in the same way the written word becomes the rule, just as the structured data prescribes its command, the severed object of music emerges as style, order, or identity. The question is, however, how can we conceive the aesthetic experience without this authoritative character; without this inherent imposition of order and identity? The space is opened, thus, for the concept of an anarchic unwork of art."><em >Composing Database: Opening A Space For The Concept Of An Anarchic Unwork Of Art</em> (Database Aesthetics).

<p title="The ACCAD Sonic Arts Ensemble (United States, Argentina, Germany) - Marc Ainger, Fede Cámara Halac, Directors - Ohio State University. NowNet Arts Conference is an annual event for artists, technologists, researchers, educators, and industry professionals advancing topics in contemporary network arts for the ongoing development of the field. The 2020 theme “Network Arts and Social Distance: Capacities and Innovations” is a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the world due to social distancing. Network arts is a prominent field for continuation of live performance with capacities for events that take place entirely online or events with in-person participants dispersed across multiple locations. Historical and current artistic network arts works show the artistic significance in transcending distance and new expressions that are achieved through this medium. While the capacities are inherent to the field, social distancing calls for further innovations to adapt the artistic, technological, and educational strategies to this new setting. The NowNet Arts Conference 2020 is a program of papers, presentations, and concert demonstrations that feature this topic and generate new innovations for this work forward. The NowNet Arts Conference 2020 is a virtual event this year. Presenters and attendees can participate from any remote site via Zoom. More information here: https://nownetarts.org/conference-2020. The online conference took place in: Institute for Advanced Computational Science (IACS), Stony Brook University, New York, USA Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), Stanford University, California, USA Edinburgh Napier University, Scotland Orpheus Institute, Ghent, Belgium."><em >NOWNET ARTS CONFERENCE 2020</em> (Networked Performance).

It's a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community. This year’s conference theme is inclusion. We want to highlight the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture but may not normally attend an academic conference, including artists and scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions. The conference is hosted by the ANU School of Music and Research School of Computer Science, College of Engineering and Computer Science. Fun fact: ACMC was last hosted in Canberra in 2010!

<p title="This paper describes and discusses several approaches to working with massively multichannel music live using pure data. traditionally, most computer music works have had a tendency towards fixed media due to its stability and robustness when it comes to performance. Likewise, the spatialization paradigm that has governed most electronic music continues to be stereo, with the use of diffusion or ambisonics as last resort spatialization techniques. Emphasizing the importance of space, this paper describes the design of a real-time computer music piece called Lorenz Variations, written directly for high density loudspeaker arrays (HDLAs) of variable lengths. In using point-source location techniques and vector-based amplitude panning (VBAP) as composing tools instead of spatialization tools, I argue that space is not just a musical parameter but a compositional source that expands our listening experience into yet unknown dimensions, and it is our duty to explore the many aesthetic potentials it advances..

<p title="The Sonic Arts Ensemble welcomes the Spring season in a live-streamed networked concert with performers in the United States, Austria, and Argentina. The event takes place on Sunday, April 11th at 3pm EDT. Performers include: Marc Ainger, Ann Stimson, Federico Cámara Halac, Se-Lien Chuang, Andreas Weixler, Scott Deal, Berenice Llorens, Jacob Kopcienski, Joe Sferra, Jim Croson, Sammy Gardner, Norah Zuniga Shaw, and Oded Huberman. This performance is a joint production with ACCAD, Atelier Avant Austria, and the Donald Tavel Arts and Technology Research Center, with funding provided by Livable Futures. Founded by Marc Ainger and Ann Stimson, the Sonic Arts Ensemble is a collaborative group of artists that comes together in different configurations over time. The artists are seeking collectively and individually to extend traditional instruments and modes of performance into new, imaginative realms of action and interaction. Relationships between the real and the imagined are re-imagined through sound."><em >The Sonic Arts Ensemble Livestream I</em> (Networked Performance).

<p title="Lockdowns and travel restrictions have not only affected our own music classes and artistic research, but have also profoundly changed music performance worldwide. In other words, since musicians cannot meet in the same room to play music with each other, they have learned to move their musical performance to the network. We argue that this translation can be thought of as a new opportunity to rethink music and music performance research, considering the network as a new performative space. As a case study, we present a '1002', a collaborative networked performance created using a custom software called 'CollidePd'. '1002' is an invitation to anonymous collaboration in real time with remote performers, without any required musical training. The sonic research of this performance is based on the sonification of the musical gesture mediated by the mobile device, emphasizing the participatory movement of the performers."><em >1002: A Networked Music Performance with CollidePd</em> (Networked Performance).
