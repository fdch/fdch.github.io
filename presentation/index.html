<h1 id="hallo">Hallo!</h1>
<p>We are Berenice and Federico, a couple of freelance composers/artists from Argentina. We are looking for our beloved, bright, warm, quiet, and ample place in Berlin We would like to introduce ourselves so that you can get a warm idea of whom you will rent your apartment.</p>
<p>We came to Germany to start a new life. We have moved to Berlin in late July 2022, and we have enough savings to afford this new beginning. Berenice is also a DJ and Federico is also a programmer. Please, have a look at the rest of our information and documents in this application.</p>
<p>For us, it is essential you know we come with our two kittens: Elektra and Panchita. We believe that taking responsibility for our actions is fundamental, that is why we decided to bring them. They are almost two years old, friendly and playful, and enjoy when we take them in their evening walks in the park.</p>
<p>At the moment, we live in a friend's apartment but soon we have to find our own. We can adapt to different spaces and places. Because we are musicians, at home <strong>we practice silence</strong>, and so we enjoy a quiet space. We sometimes work from home with headphones, but we prefer to make our music in studios and spaces with immersive sound systems.</p>
<p>Together, we have a duo called <a href="https://fdch.github.io/toros">toros</a>. Check it out if you are interested. Here is something about each of us:</p>
<h1 id="berenice">Berenice</h1>
<p>Berenice is a composer and a DJ. She works independently in different artistic research projects while developing her personal work. Her music was performed in several international music festivals (MUTEK Montréal, Now Net Arts, NY). She has been doing music production for other artists since 2020. <em>When she visited Berlin in 2017, she discovered it was her favorite place in the world to make experimental music.</em></p>
<p>Check out her work here: <a href="https://berenicellorens.github.io">berenicellorens.github.io</a></p>
<h1 id="federico">Federico</h1>
<p>Federico is an artist as well, a composer coming from academia, and he is also a programmer. He has lived and studied in New York (PhD at NYU, 2013-2019) and worked in Ohio (Postdoc at OSU, 2019-20). For over 10 years, he has been developing new music and audio programming tools. His latest projects include cutting-edge machine learning research for audio. <em>He finished his dissertation in Berlin, 2018, and like Berenice, he fell in love with the city.</em></p>

<h1 id="conslusion">Conslusion</h1>
<p>We want to find a beautiful place to live, to take care, and to start our lives in this great city. We hope that this presentation can serve as an introduction of your next tenants.</p>
<p>Please, let us know if you need more information from us.</p>
<p>Viele Grüße,</p>
