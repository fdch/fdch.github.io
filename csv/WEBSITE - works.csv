Performers read with hyperreal accuracy a hand-written proportional score composed with an essentially incorrect implementation of a zero order markov chain (i.e. an expressionistic interpolation of absurdly distributed Puckette-PRNG sequences). The live signal from one performer triggers sample capturingand resynthesis of the other performer (and viceversa), while also triggering images and image transformations projected over the body of both performers. This work is made completely with puredata and GEM, with one pre-recorded soundscape and 1025 abstracted images that were taken in transit, from vantage points and in different locations of the city of Cordoba, Argentina.

The players follow the score performing both with their potentiometer and with their instrument. The data obtained from the potentiometers is then interpreted as the speed at which a [lorenz] system is iterated (which is between 0.001 and 1 every sample, at a given samplerate, e.g 44100 Hz). The output (X,Y,Z) from each system is interpreted in two ways: first, it is read as a signal and added altogether; second, it is parsed through [siginfo] to obtain slope changes, which are as well read as signals and added altogether. Finally, the distance obtained from [siginfo] serves as gain for the final signal. One player can be given a midi input to trigger randomized variables for all (or each) lorenz system(s), generating divergence among the randomized systems. Within this midi input, one note (MIDI Note 72) serves as on/off switch for the patch. A timer is provided on the screen. The whole work lasts at least 6 minutes, but the duration bends when there are CPU overloads. It is encouraged to ""surf"" in and out of those CPU overloads by simply changing the potentiometer to a value closer to 1, or to 0 in case there is a need to stop all iterations from the potentiometer involved.

Community is made of the interruption of singularities, or of the suspension that singular beings are. Community is not the work of singular beings, nor can it claim them as it works, just as communication is not a work or even an operation of singular beings, for community is simply their being -their being suspended upon its limit.

The library uses an algorithm for swarm behavior together with the Lorenz attractor in such a way that five boids follow the famous chaotic attractor. The a.le.a library provides an interface to monitor and interact with both the Lorenz and the boids paths, thus adding to the influence of the boids' movements a human element - that of the player of the meta-score (the composer). The interface captures the results of the interaction of the trio (player, boids, attractor) and outputs the data to both a video file and a text file. The video is used for part of the visual aspect of the performance. The text is used to generate a set of four meta-scores which indicate curves of transition between three elements (in this case, the electronics, the instrumental and the visual). This algorithmic absurdity in a.le.a aims at being not a 'mapping' of the motion of the birds into musical structures, but as the triggering of events and transitions based on some properties of the line that goes through all the boids. The instrumental score is then interpreted from this output into hand-crafted gestural snippets of Lilypond code (via the [notes] external for puredata) which belong to each of the six instruments of the ensemble. This interpretation produces four fullscores (one for each meta-score). For this performance, the composer hand-trimmed and re-interpreted some absurdly incoherent blobs of ink on the page into absurdly incoherent musical gestures, choosing from all of the four fullscores arriving at a final score. The electronics and the video are generated live. They both take the third -human- element from the live analysis of the player's signals, and they both consist of spectra transformations and granular synthesis. a.le.a is not a work, it is the unworking of a work. It is not only the performative result in itself, but also the path of its unworking.

She dwelt among the untrodden ways // 
Beside the springs of Dove, //
A Maid whom there were none to praise // 
And very few to love: // //
A violet by a mossy stone //
Half hidden from the eye!  //
—Fair as a star, when only one  //
Is shining in the sky.  // //

When Lucy ceased to be;  //

8/5/2017 4:16:37,Lorenz Variations,"Fixed media, Live electronics",Fede Camara Halac,8/3/2017,For computer performer and an HDLA or as many speakers as possible,"Lorenz Variations focuses on the different interpretations of the Lorenz System, both as signal and control generator, exploring its patterns and deviations in several time-scales. More importantly, the piece relies on the computer's capability for live and extremely fast computations of the Lorenz System, reaching a point of complete CPU saturation that might crash the piece. Thus, it questions the endurance and virtuosity of the most current processing units, as well as Pure Data's DSP chain tethered through the C programming language. The choice is then, at least on macos where this work was first performed, to use portaudio or Jack, but that should be left to the computer performer. The piece has 3 sections, each of which has it's own texture and treatment but is linked in some way by the use of this system. Towards the end, there's a single gesture which simultaneously moves from space to pitch-space, and from computational stability to overload and saturation, resulting in a drastic sonic change. Lorenz Variations is the result of the Spatial Music Workshop during the Cube Fest 2017 at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, VA. About the workshosp: together with 6 other participants, we developed site specific research and compositions for the Cube, which consists of 149 speakers in a series of rings that go from the stage up to 30m ceiling surrounding the entire space.

From a mechanical point of view, it has been suggested that the human brain is a machine that performs an inverse Fourier Transform through which it constructs a geometric image from correlations of reflections of light. While a significant component of the installation is visual, the audio acts via sonification to extend the perception beyond just what the eye can see. The audience is invited to experience spectral properties outside of the more familiar visible wavelengths. This piece simultaneously addresses that the mechanical component of perception, even when perceiving one's own self, is only a part of a complex process shaped by many external stimuli, one of the strongest being societal.

The audio consists of random and chaos generators in real-time synthesis. The video contains images of turbulence taken from a river in Cordoba (Argentina), cellular automata noise, and randomized nouns. The score has ordered sections made out of randomized variables, and the last section requires some human action. Sounds and images were made with Pure Data for the Immersion Lab at NYU Bobst Library. The work was performed at the Third Cube Fest in 2018: ""Federico Camara Halac's Untitled was captivating in its raw approach to spatial music. Dry, glitchy sounds, including clicks, were pointillistically placed in time and space, sometimes darting across the speaker array, while the visuals showed words appearing and collapsing. Unfortunately, the piece ended prematurely when the composer's Pure Data patch crashed. Upon reflection, however, this was a refreshingly different way to end a concert, and suited the glitch aesthetic of the piece, albeit accidentally so."" Malinowski, D. J.

9/29/2018 4:49:49,Un-titled2,"Fixed media, Live electronics, Generative, Acousmatic, Multichannel",Fede Camara Halac,6/16/2018,Multichannel work for Laptop Performer,"Immersed in a digital environment, “untitled2” lives at the limit between field recording and synthesis, soundscape composition, and sound art. This liminality aims to resonate its way into the complex difference between art and life, and between the human and the non human.

The sound design of “untitled2” is geared towards emulating transducer signals from soundscape recordings. In order to achieve this, I recorded several soundscapes in different locations in Mykonos, Greece, analyzed the signals, and deconstructed them in their most basic perceivable elements. Thus, there are sounds that resemble seagulls, other types of birds, cicadas, storms, wind, among others. Most of these sounds are granular in nature, allowing for the possibility to spatialize them using algorithms such as the flocking algorithm and the Lorenz system of equations.

The original setup was for four channels, but by design the number of channels is variable. Therefore, the work is adaptable to any configuration of speakers of any kind, with the requirement of at least one subwoofer. The four channel version and stereo reduction of the piece have been recorded from live performance. This means that the work itself is meant to be performed live on a laptop with some basic guidelines. In addition to these guidelines, I have written the following text (in spanish) as inspiration for the first section: truena de repente // gaviotas gritan giran // rondando // // llueve a lo lejos // lluvia cae de cerca // rondando // // gritan giran gaviotas // y se van, ellas // al olvido //

The liminality of the piece appears as well in the narrow gap between silence and sound that very quiet moments point to, as well as the complete spectral saturation towards its climactic moment close to its ending. This gesture towards saturation comes from the accelerating way in which one sound generator is triggered. Specifically, the real-time computation of the chaotic system of equations commonly referred to as the Lorenz system is accelerated from one millisecond to less than 1/1000 of a millisecond, approaching computational zero-time, intentionally clogging the computer’s real-time audio capabilities.

These two poles of “untitled2,” soundscape reconstruction and computational saturation, comment on the complex, but present difference between sonic art and sonic life. The proximity between the reconstructed signal and its original creates a third sonic image, one that I like to call a ghost signal. This ghost signal permeates through the work as if it were the “real” version, turning the listening experience into an experience of the uncanny. This mysterious and unsettling experience, however, only appears in hindsight, after the piece has reached its climactic moment: the moment of complete saturation the second pole projects. Therefore, in listening to “untitled2,” I invite the listener to contemplate on the human role in its environment.

“Untitled2” was composed and premiered during the ``Delian Academy for New Music'' held in Mikonos, Greece, in June 2018

Also known as ""the Lorenz attractor"", this system promotes a movement in space similar to the drawing on the wings of a butterfly. Each interpretation takes unique gestures of the signal, such as a change of direction, or of position in space. The individuality of each gesture is given by the different initial positions which, however small the distance between them, cause very serious effects on future gestures. This concept, which speaks of the chaotic state of the system, can perhaps orient us in the crossing, in the cracks, in the middle of the abyss, where the orientation is imperceptible, original, but does not escape to be imagined. The stereo reduction of the work allows for many of the spatial nuances that arise from its multi-channel version.
