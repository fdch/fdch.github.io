2/19/2020 1:28:35,Berenice Llorens y Fede Cámara Halac,"Our goal as a duo is to experiment with a mixture of sound synthesis, spatialization, electric guitar, and analog signal processing. At the intersection of noise and pulse, our music invites the audience to leave behind preconceived musical notions of figure-ground, soloists vs accompanists, virtuoso performance, and form. This experimental leap from standard improvisation techniques allows us to explore new sonic territories that coexist between the circuitry between our bodies and the speakers, as well as between the space and the listener. Here we share some of our work with separate duos or as soloists, since we have still to document our performances together. ",,"Berenice Llorens is a composer, performer, poet, and dj from Córdoba, Argentina. Her work has been performed at La Cúpula Galería de Arte, and she is developing work for the virtual label Kriptonia. As a dj she has worked with @visicapiscis_arte and performed on multiple locations around Córdoba.
