7/2/2020 23:02:13,Australian National University School of Music,ACMC2020 (untitled2),7/9/2020,"ACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association, a place to show and discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It's a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.

This year’s conference theme is inclusion. We want to highlight the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture but may not normally attend an academic conference, including artists and scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.

The conference is hosted by the ANU School of Music and Research School of Computer Science, College of Engineering and Computer Science. Fun fact: ACMC was last hosted in Canberra in 2010!

The Australasian Computer Music Conference will take place July 3–11, 2020 as an online event.",https://computermusic.org.au/media/2013/08/cropped-acma-logo-big.png,https://acmc2020.com/poster_21.html

NowNet Arts Conference is an annual event for artists, technologists, researchers, educators, and industry professionals advancing topics in contemporary network arts for the ongoing development of the field. The 2020 theme “Network Arts and Social Distance: Capacities and Innovations” is a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the world due to social distancing. Network arts is a prominent field for continuation of live performance with capacities for events that take place entirely online or events with in-person participants dispersed across multiple locations. Historical and current artistic network arts works show the artistic significance in transcending distance and new expressions that are achieved through this medium. While the capacities are inherent to the field, social distancing calls for further innovations to adapt the artistic, technological, and educational strategies to this new setting. The NowNet Arts Conference 2020 is a program of papers, presentations, and concert demonstrations that feature this topic and generate new innovations for this work forward.

The NowNet Arts Conference 2020 is a virtual event this year. Presenters and attendees can participate from any remote site via Zoom.
