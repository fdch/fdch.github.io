OPENING PORTALS
</p>
<p>
by Jessica Rosen
</p>
<p>
Featuring Fede Camara Halac
</p>
<p>
OPENING PORTALS is a live show that occupies a space between experimental music, performance and ritual. The performance combines elements of meditation, energetic channeling and experimental sound to escort the audience to new levels of consciousness. During the performance, Jessica uses crystals and mantra to enter a state of trance and open portals of communication with other dimensions. For this performance, Jessica built an instrument that is a source of both chromatically tuned light as well as resonant noise. The performance will be realized in collaboration with the musician/researcher Fede Camara Helac who will create an immersive soundscape to transport the audience through the energetic portals that are being opened.

TIRED MUSIC 
</p>
<p>
by Joe Snape
</p>
<p>
Tired Music is composed from a personal archive of instrumental, vocal and field recordings made over five years. Imperfectly reproduced by a set of simple oscillators, complex sounds are stripped of all but their most elemental acoustic character. Like a levelled snowfield or a smoothed pebble, the plane surfaces of these sounds speak to something bigger: of being slowly, gently and thoroughly worn away.
