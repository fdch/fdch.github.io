<h4>program notes</h4>
<p>This work is about the mirroring space and the imaging of gestures in music and in ink. The audience is invited to contemplate subtle and abrupt movements in different topologies and to engage with the uncanny sensation of acoustic displacement. The title of this work comes from Julio Cortazar's Rayuela (Hopscotch). Talita and Traveler -Horacio Oliveira's friends- live in Buenos Aires and they constitute an image of Horacio and La Maga, who live in Paris. Throughout the novel, places and characters are misteriously interchangeable, just like the order in which you can read the chapters of the book, and the sequences and spatializations in
this composition.</p>
